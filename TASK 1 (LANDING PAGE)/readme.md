The "Task 1 Landing Page" project showcases different vehicles from PUBG/BGMI with dynamic content and animations. Users can select vehicles like UAZ, Dacia, and Buggy, and the page updates vehicle details (speed, range) and triggers a car animation. It consists of an HTML structure, CSS styling for layout and animations, and JavaScript to handle interactivity.

Key Features:

Dynamic Content Update:
When a user clicks on a vehicle's name (like "UAZ" or "DACIA"), the background changes to reflect that vehicle's image, and vehicle details such as 0-60 mph time, top speed, and range are updated.

Car Animation:
A smooth animation is applied to the car image that simulates movement when a vehicle is selected, providing a more interactive and immersive experience.

Responsive Design:
The page adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring it remains functional and aesthetically pleasing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Basic structure of the page, including vehicle names, details, and navigation.
CSS: Layout styling, animations, transitions, and background settings.
JavaScript: Handles dynamic changes to the page (background image, vehicle details, and animations) based on user interaction.
